      We put 1 pill of bottle 1, 2 pills of bottle 2, 3 pills of bottle 3... 20 pills of bottle 20 on the scale.
      We consider them all as 1 gram weight, and we will get 210 grams total.
      By looking at how many grams more than 210, we can find out which bottle is the one we want.
      Say we have got 210.07 grams, we know bottle 7 is the one we want.
      We should compute n = (result-210)/0.1
