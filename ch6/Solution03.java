        It is impossible.

        We have 32 white squares and 32 black squares. After we cut off two corners, we only have 32 white(black)
        and 30 black(white).

        A domino covers exactly two squares, which should contain 1 white and 1 black. We are unable to satisfy this
        because we have unequal numbers of black and white squares.
