        Step 2: Pour 2 quarts water into 3-quart jug.

        Step 3: Fill the 5-quart jug and pour into the 3-quart jug.

        Step 4: As there is already 2 quarts water in the 3-quart jug, you can only pour in 1 quarts water into
                the 3-quart jug.

        Step 5: Now you have exactly 4 quarts water remaining in your 5-quart jug.
