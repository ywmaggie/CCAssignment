        Suppose there is 1 blue-eyed person on island, the first day he saw no one with blue eyes. Then he knew it
        should be himself who has blue eyes, so he would leave on the first day.

        Suppose there are 2 blue-eyed people on island, the first day they both saw 1 blue-eyed person, so they do
        not know if themselves are blue-eyed or not. Then they found out that no one leaved on the first day.
        If there is only 1 blue-eyed person, he should have leaved on the first they. They knew there are at least 2
        blue-eyed people on island. They leave on the second day.

        So if there are n blue-eyed people on island, if they think themselves are not blue-eyed, all the others should
        leave on the n-1 days, but no one did. So they all leave on the nth day.
